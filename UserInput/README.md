# UserInput is similar to Key but UserInput use UserInputService instead of instance (more performance)

Some module in _Input require "Signal,Trove" i suggest to look at require error if this happen and insert them at the correct location
or if you already have them just change the actual path like you need dont forget to also change UserInput Signal module path if needed.
